# qs-ext-picasso-emptystart
Here you can find JS code to be used as a starting point for a Qlik Sense *Picasso extension* which makes use of the open-sourced picassojs.com. 

This is an empty wrap only, but made ready to more or less copy/paste Json code from https://beta.observablehq.com in here.

For example I did this based on that chart https://beta.observablehq.com/@miralemd/picasso-js-range-area-chart ...
You can see the result in subfolder "finishedexamples" in here, in case you get off track ;-)
