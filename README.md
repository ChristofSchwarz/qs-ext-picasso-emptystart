Here you can find JS code to be used as a starting point for a Qlik Sense *Picasso extension* which makes use of the open-sourced picassojs.com

Although this already contains a specific picasso chart (the Range-Area chart from here  https://beta.observablehq.com/@miralemd/picasso-js-range-area-chart ) this can easily be used as starting point for another Picasso chart. Try it out (what you see it what you get) on https://picassojs.com and copy/paste the Json code from https://beta.observablehq.com (which is the playground page behind) into the newpicasso.js file from here. 

To "reset" this chart and get a new one, just remove or comment out everything between the rows with down triangles ▼▼▼ and up triangles ▲▲▲ ...
