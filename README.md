# qs-ext-picasso-emptystart
Here you can find JS code to be used as a starting point for a Qlik Sense *Picasso extension* which makes use of the open-sourced picassojs.com

Although this example already contains a specific picasso chart (the Range-Area chart from here  https://beta.observablehq.com/@miralemd/picasso-js-range-area-chart ) this can very easily be used as starting point for another Picasso chart. 

1) To "reset" this .js and begin with a new chart, just remove or comment out everything between the rows with down triangles ▼▼▼ and up triangles ▲▲▲ ...
2) Best place to try out the settings in a what you see it what you get manner is the "Examples" section on https://picassojs.com This will take you to  https://beta.observablehq.com (the playground page behind) 
3) When done, copy/paste your Json definitions into the newpicasso.js file from this package
4) Watch for the inline-comments which tell you where to paste what.

This is contained in the sample:
